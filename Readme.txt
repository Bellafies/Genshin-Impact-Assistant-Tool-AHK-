Ive been using this Script since ive started the game, so dont fear a ban. 
I just got tired from the clicking and spamming the buttons and some other problems that you might also have. 

This Script helps you with

- Auto Walking with Sprinting (XButton 1) 
- Auto Attacking (XButton 2)
- Auto Pickup (F)
- Space spamming (Space)
- Auto talk with Npcs (Shift + Space) 
- Fast exit (MButton)

Feel free to edit the code as you wish and set it up that it works with you.

/// Known bugs ///

- While you sprint and press some other buttons (Shift) its gonna stop, thats because youve pressed shift bevore the programm could, when this happens just toggle the sprint again and it should work
