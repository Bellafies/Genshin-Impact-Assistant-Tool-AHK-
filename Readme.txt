# Genshin-Impact-Assistant-Tool-AHK-

Ive been using this Script since ive started the game, so dont fear a ban. (Im still playing)
I just got tired from the clicking and spamming the buttons and some other problems that you might also have. 

This Script helps you with

- Auto Walking with Sprinting (XButton 1) 
- Auto Attacking (XButton 2)
- Auto Pickup (F)
- Space spamming (Space)
- Auto talk with Npcs (Shift + Space) 
- Fast exit (MButton)

/// Important ///

- You need basic info of .ahk to change the keys, i mean rly basic stuff, use this site to know which key you can use --> https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/KeyList.htm
- For the Sprint, just find out how long you sprint (In my case 8 Sec) and write it in the code, ive marked it.

/// Known bugs ///

- While you sprint and press some other buttons (Shift) its gonna stop, thats because youve pressed shift bevore the programm could, when this happens just toggle the sprint again and it should work
